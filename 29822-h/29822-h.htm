conjunction with <span class="smcapl">FANTASTIC UNIVERSE</span>, it was the unanimous opinion of the
judges that a second story by Mr. O'Hara, <span class="smcapl">RESCUE SQUAD</span>, deserved honorable
mention. We think you'll agree with that decision when you've read this
documentary-type science-fiction yarn, which so excitingly combines realistic

<p class="pr1"><big><b>Stark disaster to a brave lad in space may&mdash;to the
mind that loves&mdash;be a tragedy pridefully concealed.</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">The mail ship</span>, MR4, spun
crazily through space a million
miles off her trajectory. Her black-painted
hull resembled a long
thermonuclear weapon, and below
her and only a scant twenty million
miles away burned the hungry,
flaming maw of the Sun.</p>

<p>The atomic-powered refrigeration
units of the MR4 were working
full blast&mdash;and still her internal
and external temperatures were
slowly and inexorably rising. Her
atomic engines had been long since
silenced&mdash;beaten by the inexhaustible,
fiery strength of the invincible
opponent waiting patiently a narrowing
twenty million miles "below."</p>

<p>Hal Burnett twisted painfully on
the narrow space-bunk, his tormented
body thrusting desperately
against the restraining bands of the
safety straps that lashed him in
against the dangers of non-gravity.</p>

<p>He moaned, and twisted sideways,
while his half-asleep mind
struggled on an almost instinctive
level against a dimly-remembered,
utterly intolerable reality.</p>

<p>It was a losing battle. He was
suddenly wide awake, staring in
horror at the vibrating bulkheads
of the deserted little mail ship. For
a moment his conscious barriers
against reality were so completely
down that he felt mortally terrified
and overwhelmed by the vast emptiness
about him. For a moment
the mad idea swept into his mind
that perhaps the universe was just
another illusion, an echo of man's
own inner loneliness.</p>

<p>Realizing his danger, Burnett
quickly undid the restraining safety
straps, sat up and propelled himself
outward from the edge of his
bunk. The sudden surge of physical
action swept the cobwebs from his
mind.</p>

<p>He thought of his father&mdash;and
there was bitterness in his heart
and frustration, and a rebellious,
smouldering anger. The old man
would never know how close he
had come to cracking up.</p>

<p>For a moment he wondered fearfully
if his father's cold and precise
appraisal of his character and courage
had been correct. Suppose he
<i>was</i> unable to stand the rigid strains
and pressures of a real emergency.
Suppose&mdash; He tightened his lips in
defiant self-justification. What did
they expect of a twenty-year-old
kid anyway? He was, after all, the
youngest and probably the greenest
mail pilot in the entire Universal
Run.</p>

<p>Suddenly the defensive barriers
his mind had thrown up against
the grievous flaw in his character,
which made him feel uncertain of
himself when he should have felt
strong and capable, crumbled away
completely. He could no longer
pretend, no longer deceive himself.
He hated his father because the
elder Burnett had never known a
moment of profound self-distrust
in his entire life.</p>

<p>He remembered his father's favorite
line of reasoning with a
sudden, overwhelming resentment.
"Fear can and must be controlled.
If you have your objective clearly
in mind a new experience, no matter
how hazardous, will quickly
become merely a routine obstacle
to be surmounted, a yardstick by
which a man can measure his own
maturity and strength of purpose.
You'll find peace of mind in doing
your work ably and well and by
ignoring all danger to yourself."</p>

<p>It was so easy to say, so hard
to live up to. How, for instance,
could a twenty-year-old kid on his
<i>first</i> mail run hope to completely
outwit fatigue, or even forget, for
a single moment, that it <i>was</i> his
first run. Fatigue had caused his
undoing, but had he been completely
fearless he might have
found a way to save himself, might
have managed somehow to prevent
the small, navigational errors from
piling up until they had carried
him past the point of no return.</p>

<p>A constant re-checking of every
one of his instruments might have
saved him. But he had been too
terrified to think straight, and too
ashamed of his "first-run" inexperience
to send out a short wave
message requesting emergency instructions
and advice. Now he was
hopelessly off his course and it was
too late. Too late!</p>

<p>He could almost feel the steadily-growing
pull of his mindless
enemy in the distant sky. Floating
and kicking his way over to the
Tele-screen, he quickly switched the
instrument on. Rotating the control
dials, he brought the blinding
white image of the onrushing solar
disk into perfect focus. Automatically
he adjusted the two superimposed
polaroid filters until the
proper amount of light was transmitted
to his viewing screen. They
really built ships and filters these
days, he reflected wryly. Now if
they could only form a rescue squad
just as easily&mdash;</p>

<p>Even through the viewing screen
he could almost feel the hot blast
of white light hit his face with
the physical impact of a baseball
bat. With what was almost a whimper
of suppressed fear he rocked
backward on his heels.</p>

<p>The Sun's ghastly prominences
seemed to reach beckoning fingers
toward him, as its flood of burning,
radiant light seared through
the incalculable cold of space, and
its living corona of free electrons
and energy particles appeared to
swell and throb menacingly.</p>

<p>Fearfully he watched the flaming
orb draw closer and closer, and
as its pull grew more pronounced
he wondered if it were not, in
some nightmarishly fantastic fashion
becoming malignantly aware of
him. It resembled nothing so much
as a great festering sore; an infection
of the very warp-and-woof
stuff of space.</p>

<p>He flipped off the power control
on the Tele-screen and watched
the image fade away with a depleted
whine of dying energy. That
incandescent inferno out there&mdash; Grimly
he tried to recall the name
of the man who had said that,
philosophically, energy is not actually
a real thing at all.</p>

<p>He knew better than to waste
time trying the pilot controls again.
They were hopelessly jammed by
the great magnetic attraction of the
Sun. They had been jammed for
hours now. He forced his way back
to his bunk, and securely lashed
himself to it again. Sleep was his
only hope now, his only real escape
from the growing, screaming hysteria
within him.</p>

<p>He flung an arm across his tired
face. His thin features trembled
as he remembered the continuous
alterations in his trajectory that had
brought him within range of the
Sun's mighty pull. He remembered
also every detail of the last and
gravest of the series of miscalculations
that had swept him from the
established route of the regular
Venus-Mercury mail run, and
threatened him with a violent,
flaming end.</p>

<p>Greatly off course, he had been
approaching Mercury, a routine
thirty-six million miles from the
Sun. On this, the final leg of his
long journey, he had deviated just
far enough from the extreme limits
of safety to find himself and his
ship gripped inexorably in the
mighty magnetic fields of the Sun's
passage....</p>

<p>He remembered a name&mdash; Josephine.</p>

<p>There would be no lover's meeting
now on the green fields of
Earth in the dusk of a summer
evening. There would be no such
meeting now. Not unless the prayers
and dreams a boy and a girl
had shared had followed him,
plunging senselessly into the cold
glacial heart of interstellar space.</p>

<p>His false bravado began to break
and he began to weep quietly. He
began to wish with all his heart
that he had never left home.</p>

<p>The sudden crackling of the
almost static-jammed ultra-wave
radio snapped through to his mind.
Quickly he began to free himself
from the bunk.</p>

<p>"MR4, come in, MR4."</p>

<p>An eternity seemed to pass as
he floated across the room, deliberately
disregarding the strategically-placed
hand-grips on the walls,
floor, and ceiling. It seemed aeons
before he reached the narrow little
control compartment, and got the
ultra-wave radio into action, nearly
wrecking it in his clumsy-fingered
haste.</p>

<p>"MR4 to Earth. Over."</p>

<p>He waited a few moments and
then repeated the message as no
acknowledgment came through.
Then he abruptly remembered the
nearby presence of the Sun and
its interference with radio transmission
and reception. He was
white and shaken by the time his
message was received and his report
requested and given.</p>

<p>He gave the whole tragic picture
in frantic short wave. The amount
of atomic fuel left in the ship, the
internal and external temperatures,
the distance from the Sun, and the
strength of the solar disk's magnetic
field and his rate of drift toward
it&mdash;along with a staggering list of
other pertinent factors.</p>

<p>At last it was over and he stood
by awaiting the decision from Earth
headquarters.</p>

<p>It came at last.</p>

<p>"MR4." The growling voice was
Donnelly's, the huge space-engineer
in charge of the smaller mail-rocket
units. "You're in a tough spot but
we've got an expert here from the
Government. He's worked on deals
like this with me before and he's
got an idea.</p>

<p>"Here's the substance of it.
We're going to send out a space
tug from Mercury to see if we can
haul you in. It's a new, experimental
tug and it's been kept under
wraps until now. But it's been
designed for jobs like this and we
figure it can sure as hell do it.</p>

<p>"There's just one hitch, though,
kid. It's a mighty powerful ship so
there's going to be a terrific shock
when it contacts you and the magnetic
grapples set to work. In your
medicine kit you'll find a small
hypo in a red-sealed plastic box.
Take the shot that's in it immediately
and we'll have the tug out
there as soon as we can. It will
probably take about twelve hours."</p>

<p>Donnelly's voice broke and he
hesitated strangely for a moment.
"You'll be out fast," he went on.
"So you won't feel a thing when
the shock wave hits you. There's
less chance of injuries, this way."</p>

<hr />

<p>"It's a lousy thing to do," cried
Donnelly as he snapped off the
set. "A rotten, heartless way of
giving the lad false hopes. But
then you don't give a damn about
anybody's feelings but your own,
do you, Doc?"</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Joe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Williams. I'm talking
to this little Government time-server
over here, not to you."</p>

<p>The psychiatrist shrugged wearily.
"I don't care what you think.
I've worked with you both on
cases similar to this before, though
I'll admit that none of them were
quite as hopeless. In any case, I'll
do it my way, or not at all."</p>

<p>"Maybe you will, maybe you
will," said Donnelly. "But if I had
to wait thirty days in that thing
and somebody told me it was only
a matter of hours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what I'm doing even
if you think that I don't. The
Government has developed a set
approach in matters like this. Fortunately,
there aren't many of them.
Perhaps if there were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me take over, Doc," broke
in Donnelly. "I'm a space-engineer
and that makes me far better qualified
to handle this than you are.
Why the hell they ever put a psychiatrist
on this job in the first
place is something I'll never know,
if I live to be a hundred and ten.
It's a job for an engineer, not a
brain washer."</p>

<p>"There's a lot of things you'll
never know, Donnelly," the gaunt,
thin little man sighed wearily. He
sat down at the long mahogany
table in the Radio Room. With
a careless wave of one arm, he
swept a pile of papers and magazines
to the floor.</p>

<p>"Try and get this through your
head, Donnelly. There's not too
much you can do by yourself for
that boy up there. You just don't
know how to cope with the psychological
intangibles. That's why
they have me here&mdash;so that we
could work together as a team.</p>

<p>"Now the sooner you get on that
radio and follow my instructions
for the pilot the sooner we'll get
this over with. Then maybe I can
go home and spend a hundred
years trying to forget about it.
Until then please try and keep
your personal opinions to yourself.
Please."</p>

<p>Donnelly's face flushed a still
deeper red. His fists clenched and,
as a muscle started to twitch warningly
in his cheek, he started to get
up. He stopped for a moment&mdash;frozen
in silence. Then he relaxed
and pushed back his chair. With
a heavy sigh, he maneuvered his
huge bear of a body to its feet.</p>

<p>He rumbled something disgustedly
in his throat and then spat
casually on the floor. "Williams,"
he thundered. "Get the hell out
of here and get us some coffee."</p>

<p>He waited a moment until the
only witness had left the room and
then, with grim determination, he
turned to the little psychiatrist
seated at the table.</p>

<p>"You, Doc," he said coldly and
with deliberate malice, "are a
dirty, unclean little&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p>Williams, when he eased his
slight body through the door a few
minutes later, found a suspicious
scene. The little doctor, his face
flushed and rage-twisted, his effortless
and almost contemptuous composure
shaken for once, was on
his feet. Speechless, he faced the
grinning space-engineer who was
waving a huge and warning finger
in his face.</p>

<p>"Easy, Doc," Donnelly roared
in a friendly voice. "I might take
advantage of it if you keep on
giving me a good excuse. Then
where would all your psychiatry
and your fine overlording manners
get you?"</p>

<p>"Joe," yelled Williams in explosive
sudden fright. "Leave him
alone. You're liable to have the
Government Police down on us."</p>

<p>"Sure, Williams. The police and
the newspapers too. They'd just
love to have the taxpayers find out
what they're doing to those kids
out in deep space. What would they
call it, Doc? Just an interesting
psychological experiment? Is that
what it's meant to be, eh, Doc?"</p>

<p>He chuckled suddenly as the
little doctor flinched under his
virulent attack. "I really hit the
spot that time, didn't I, Doc? So
that's what the Government's so
scared and hush-hush about.
They're really scared to hell and
back, aren't they? I wonder what's
really going on behind all this?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward, suddenly
roaring and ferocious. "Why are
Williams and I followed everywhere
we go when we leave here?
To see who we talk to? Is that the
way of it? Why do quite a few
of the ships you and I and Williams
have rescued in the past few
years never show up again? Just
where are they? I don't see them
reported missing in the newspapers,
either."</p>

<p>He leaned back in exhausted
satisfaction at the look on the
little doctor's face. "Yeah, Doc,
the only way to get anything out
of you is to blast it out, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Pale and frightened, Williams
hurried across the room to the
table and, with shaky hands, took
out three containers of coffee from
the paper bag and passed them out.</p>

<p>Nobody bothered to thank him.</p>

<p>The hidden tension in the room
had begun to mount steadily, so
Donnelly helped it out a little.</p>

<p>"Is this the first time you've ever
been on the defensive, Doc?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Williams jumped in before the
explosion. "When will the rocket
get to the kid's ship, Doctor?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"In about thirty days," the little
man answered, coldly and deliberately.</p>

<p>Williams blinked in surprise.
"Good Lord," he said. "I thought
it was supposed to be in twelve
hours or so?"</p>

<p>"That's the whole point," snapped
Donnelly. "That's what I'm
so fighting mad about. Think of it
yourself, Williams. Suppose you
had a son or a brother up there,
how would you feel about this
whole infernal, lying business?</p>

<p>"I don't get it," he went on.
"I just don't get the big central
idea behind it. Don't all these tugs
we send out ever get there? First
they tell the kid he'll have his
life saved in twelve hours or so.
Then they get him to take a shot
so his mind won't crack up while
he's waiting.</p>

<p>"Now they know very well the
shot won't last for thirty days. If
it did he'd starve to death. So
what have they accomplished?
Nothing. As a matter of fact
they've made things worse instead
of better. What's going to happen
to that poor kid when he wakes
up in twelve hours and finds out
he still has to wait for thirty more
days? What's going to happen to
him then, Doc? Don't you think
that kid will really go off his rocker
for sure?"</p>

<p>Donnelly and Williams both
looked at the little psychiatrist. He
sat again at his former place at the
table, white and shaken. His face
was once again buried in one hand.</p>

<p>"Come on, Doc," whispered
Williams, quietly. "What's going
on here, anyway?"</p>

<p>"That's enough," cried the doctor,
suddenly. He sprang up and
strode toward the door. "Leave
me alone," he exclaimed, almost
in tears. "By heaven, I've had
enough of this. I've had all I can
stand."</p>

<p>Donnelly moved to block the
door and the psychiatrist came
abruptly to a halt. "That ain't
enough, Doc. You get out after
you talk."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Joe."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Williams, I'm warning
you for the last time."</p>

<p>"Let me by. I warn you, Donnelly.
Let me by."</p>

<p>Williams moved in, regaining
a sudden spurt of assurance. "What
about that kid up there, Doc? Nobody's
letting him by, are they,
Doc?"</p>

<p>A look of utter weariness swept
across the doctor's face.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "You may
as well know the truth then. You
won't like or understand it, but
here it is anyway. You see, there
isn't any tug up there, experimental
or otherwise. There was only our
need for a good excuse&mdash;in this
present case&mdash;to get him to take
the drug. You're a space-engineer
and a good one, Donnelly. That's
why you were chosen for this job.
If anybody could help those kids,
you could."</p>

<p>Donnelly's face tightened warningly
and the doctor hurried on.
"You would have known about it
if there had been any experimental
models developed even if they had
been secret. As a matter of fact,
with your standing, you would
probably have been working on
them."</p>

<p>"Why all this, then, Doc?
Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," the little doctor hesitated&mdash;and
then shrugged. "I may
as well tell you. It's not going to
make any difference now, anyway.
It was all done to put him out for
several hours until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until what, Doc?" Donnelly's
tone was harsh and uncompromising.</p>

<p>"You must understand that I'm
under orders. I'm doing what is
done in all these cases. Though
heaven help me, I wish I didn't
have to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doc," Donnelly roared. "You
have been contradicting yourself all
along and I intend to find out why."</p>

<p>"There isn't much more to find
out.... Wait."</p>

<p>The doctor strode quickly over
to the radio, and glanced at his
wristwatch. His face haggard with
strain, he turned to Williams.
"Will you contact the MR4,
please?"</p>

<p>He held up a silencing hand to
Donnelly. "There's a reason behind
all this. Just wait for a moment,
please. Just wait and listen&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a fumbling-fingered ten
minutes later, after Donnelly had
signed off, that Hal Burnett finally
found the tiny red plastic box in
the little emergency medical kit.
Trembling he held it in his hand
as he floated in free fall.</p>

<p>It was a little red key&mdash;a key
to Earth, to life and to the chance
to ram every cold, precise, contemptuous
word down his father's over-analytical
mouth.</p>

<p>He didn't really hate the old
man but he knew that he feared
him. He feared also that his father
might be right about him after
all. Who in his own mind, he
thought bitterly, should know a son
better than that son's own father.</p>

<p>A quick surge of elation swept
over him as he swam quickly to
the Tele-screen and switched it on.
It wasn't a bit like saying good-bye
to an old friend, he thought, as
he gazed at the flaming prominences
not so far below him. After
a while he switched the instrument
off and swam triumphantly back
to his bunk.</p>

<p>There were some tri-dimensional
color slides in the ditty bag hanging
by his bunk. He took them out
and looked at them. None of them
were of his father.</p>

<p>The girl was there, though. She
was a small, cute girl with a rainbow
of laughter wreathed about
her. She hadn't been really important
before, but she sure was important
now that he was going to
live. His old man had foretold
that, too.</p>

<p>After a little while he put the
slides back in the portable holder
and broke open the plastic box. It
contained a gleaming hypo filled
with what looked like a small
quantity of water. There was an
odd peppermint-like odor about it.</p>

<p>There were no instructions. Just
the needle and the little red box.</p>

<p>He wondered how many hours
he would have to wait before help
would come. But that didn't matter.
He would be asleep, anyway.</p>

<p>The temperature had climbed. It
was burning, roaring hot.</p>

<p>Gently he slid the needle into
his arm and depressed the plunger....</p>

<hr />

<p>The MR4 continued to spin even
more lazily in space. Her sun-blackened
hull, pitted by the glancing
blows of by-passing meteor
fragments, was slowly overheating.
Her refrigeration units were gradually
breaking down under their tremendous
overload.</p>

<p>She was inching in ever-shortening
circles always in the direction
of the massive, molten globe not
so far below....</p>

<p>Sometime later, Hal Burnett
awakened slowly, as if from some
distant and dimly-remembered
dream. The haze of a deep and
foggy sleep clung to the unfamiliar
mass that was his mind.</p>

<p>A distant alarm bell had rung
deep within the primitive, subcortical
levels of his brain. It had
rung&mdash;but not loudly nor insistently
enough. It had failed to cut
through the eddying fog that was
rising slowly into his ebbing consciousness.</p>

<p>He did not remember undoing
the straps with benumbed and
aching fingers. He did not remember
the befogged and stumbling
"walk" into the Control Room.
Dimly, as if viewing himself and
the room from a distant world,
he switched on the dying hum of
the radio and tried futilely to transmit
a message.</p>

<p>The faint crackle of the radio
grew more distant. He slumped
forward in the bucket seat, his head
striking the controls in front of
him&mdash;and, for him, the sounds of
the muted radio died out completely.</p>

<p>The burning heat seared into the
metal hull of the MR4. Its outer
hull was almost at the boiling
point. Inside, it was a burning,
suffocating hell. Perhaps it was the
heat that aroused Hal Burnett once
again. Somehow he managed to
stumble to the Tele-screen. With
the last vestige of a waning strength,
he managed to switch it on and
hold himself erect.</p>

<p>The stupendous white blast of
the Sun struck across his staring
eyes, but he did not flinch. Unconscious,
his hands clutched at the
control knobs as his sagging legs
let him drift weightlessly toward
the floor. He was like a drowning
swimmer, out of control and helplessly
floating under water.</p>

<p>He seemed to become aware for
a moment as a last flicker of consciousness
crossed his mind. He
mouthed something unintelligible&mdash;a
last, forgotten word.</p>

<p>Anchored only by his grip on
the control knobs, his weightless
body floated aimlessly in the almost
steaming cabin as the awful stillness
re-echoed throughout the hollow
vault of the ship.</p>

<p>Down below, with ever-growing
closeness, the Sun waited patiently,
like a bright and hovering vulture.</p>

<p>The MR4 swung and pivoted
gently like a ship at sea straining
at its anchor in the first, fresh
breezes of a gathering storm. For
a moment it seemed to hesitate like
a coy maiden on the verge of some
unknown threshold. Then, abruptly,
she climaxed her voyage and
plunged directly toward the waiting
Sun some twenty million miles
below, carrying with her only her
dead cargo; her pilot&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p>The radio crackled noisily after
Hal Burnett's last incoherent transmission.
It crackled aimlessly for
a few moments&mdash;and then was
still.</p>

<p>"Something's wrong," said Williams,
a thin thread of moisture
shining down his face. "Something's
gone wrong up there!"</p>

<p>"It sure has," said Donnelly,
quietly. "And I know who I'm
going to ask about it."</p>

<p>The little doctor said nothing.
His face was an embittered parchment
mask. "It's happened. God
help me. It's happened. He's gone,"
he muttered, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>Donnelly sighed heavily, a look
almost of defeat sweeping momentarily
across his features. "See
here, Doc," he said exhaustedly.
"Don't be so heartless about people.
You've got a son of your own in
space, so you ought to understand
how other people feel. What kind
of a father would do a thing like
this to another man's son anyway?"</p>

<p>"Look, Donnelly," said the little
man with bitter weariness. "Do me
a favor will you? You fill out the
reports tonight. Somehow or other
I just don't feel up to it."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's your conscience,"
said Donnelly, sarcastically. "But
I'll be damned if I'll do it for you.
You don't like to do your own
dirty work, do you, Doc? I thought
you just loved to fill out Government
reports."</p>

<p>"Donnelly, Donnelly," cried the
doctor in sudden anguish. "Can't
you understand yet. Even an undertaker's
job is unpleasant but somebody's
got to do it. Don't you see
yet? <i>It has to be done!</i>"</p>

<p>With a muffled groan of disgust,
Donnelly sprang to the radio once
again, pushing Williams roughly
aside. Futilely, and in desperation
he strained at the controls for a
moment and then, with a roar of
fury, he turned back to the doctor.</p>

<p>"Now see here, Doc&mdash;" he
thundered, and then stopped in
amazement.</p>

<p>The door to the dim and ill-lighted
outer hallway of the lab
was standing open. And at the far
end, the outer door was quietly
closing behind the disappearing
figure of the bent-shouldered little
man.</p>

<p>Donnelly started to spring after
him, and then abruptly stopped.
His huge figure slumped in sudden
despairing futility as he recognized
the tragic hopelessness of the situation.</p>

<p>"Let him go," rasped Williams.
"There's nothing we can do now
anyway, Joe."</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah. Let's write the report
up ourselves. That's real
important, you know. The Government
needs it."</p>

<p>He sat down at the typewriter,
his heavy features twisted in hopeless
bitterness and anger. He started
typing, and then stopped for
a moment.</p>

<p>"What was this kid pilot's full
name, Williams?"</p>

<p>Williams checked the Government
order sheet. "Hell," he said.
"Strangely, it's the same as the
doctor's, Dr. Alfred Burnett. Only
the kid's name is Harold Burnett."</p>

<p>Donnelly sat, suddenly transfixed,
staring at his typewriter. A peculiar
look flashed across his face. Then
he shook his massive head in an
unbelieving gesture of agonized
understanding.</p>

<p>"Hell, no," he muttered to himself.
"It couldn't be. It just couldn't
be. It just isn't possible. Burnett!
<i>Burnett!</i>"</p>

<p>Swiftly he was on his feet and
moving through the door after the
vanished figure of the little doctor,
his face a mask of grim remorse.</p>

<p>"It was merciful," he muttered.
"Yes, it <i>was</i> merciful. It was the
only thing Doc Burnett could have
done."</p>

<p>Williams stared after Donnelly's
disappearing figure in frank and
open-mouthed amazement.</p>

<p>"Hey, Joe," he yelled. "Where
the hell are you going?"</p>

<p>The outer door slammed shut on
the departing echo of his words.
"Well, I'll be hung for an ugly
son!" he muttered to himself. "Nobody
makes sense around this place,
any more."</p>

<p>He shrugged half to himself and
then began to type out the rest
of the report.</p>

<p>"I don't get it," he mumbled to
himself. "I just don't get it at all.
There's no logic in it."</p>
